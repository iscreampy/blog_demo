# Welcome!

I am a data enthusiast. I document my Data Science journey here with wide-ranging difficulty levels of projects 
from beginner to advanced. I value code readability, code efficiency, and being able to draw insights (or) develop ML based applications that organisations could 
leverage more than anything else. 

I hope you find some value in my documentation or my projects. Feel free to email me [here](mailto:dineshkesaboina@gmail.com) incase 
you need to communicate with me :)
