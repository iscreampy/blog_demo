    "## 7. Unified function to extract english tweets\n",
    "Here we create a unified function that can extract all the english tweets from a directory containing text files of tweets. The input to the function is the ```file_path``` to the directory and the ```data_type``` we want to process. Note that ```sample``` is a default argument for the function, ie, if we give the path of full files and do not mention the ```data_type``` to be ```full``` the output XML is created using sample data. This is because running full data takes a lot of compute and we want to avoid accidental runs of this function. <b> So unless the keyword argument data_type is equal to \"full\", the full data is not processed. </b>"
