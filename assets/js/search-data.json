Read files from the directory . In this section we read all the text files from a given directory. The function read_files takes an OS file path as the argument and returns a list of text files contained in that file path. Here we use os package&#39;s listdir method.

We then proceed to check if a given file is a regular file and if it is a text file using the aforementioned module&#39;s isfile and endswith methods respectively. . def read_files(file_path): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function returns a list of texts containing all the text files in a file path Args: file_path (str, mandatory) : Path to a file directory.

Extract the data tag . We need to extract just the data tag from our text files. In order to extract just that part from the data which is in string format, we write a regex pattern to extract this data. . . &lt;font size=5, color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Regex explanation &lt;/font&gt; . data_pattern = r&#39;&#39;&#39;(?&lt;=&quot;data&quot;:) [ {.* :.* } ] ,&#39;&#39;&#39; | . This regex is designed keeping mind that the data tag starts with a [{ and has some character data followed by a : (colon) followed by more charcters (. matches any character). We take advantage of the fact that the data tag ends with }], to design our regex. Notice that we escape the special characters (known as metacharacters) using a backslash. . Following the creation of this regex, we use re module&#39;s search method. This method looks through a string and finds the first occurrence of a pattern.

From examining the file, we see that it has two tags : data and errors. We now need to parse this text to extract textual information from this data. In order to do that, we create four functions : . get_tweet_ids: Get all the ids from the text | get_tweet_texts: Get all the texts from the text | get_tweet_timedates: Get all the dates and times from the text | get_full_tweets: Create a full tweet dictionary using the above functions | . . &lt;font size=5, color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Regex explanation &lt;/font&gt; . id_pattern = r&#39;(?P&lt;id&gt;(?&lt;=&quot;id&quot;: &quot;) d+(?= &quot;))&#39; | . In order to extract the ids from all the texts we use a named group called id to capture all the text ids. We use a positive look behind to get the text appears after &quot;id&quot;:, we then match one or more digits followed by a positive look ahead that looks for a &quot;(quotation mark) ahead of the match. Note that we escape the question mark using a backslash( ). . (?P&lt;text&gt;(?&lt;=&quot;text&quot;: &quot;)[^&quot;].*?(?= &quot;[,}][^ s d])) | . In order to extract the texts data from all the texts we use a named group called text to capture all the text data.We use a positive look behind to get the string appearing after &quot;text&quot;:, we then match one or more characters that are not quotation marks, we do this using a negated character class. Note the use of question mark( ? )to implement this lazily. We then implement a positive look ahead to look for either a &quot;(quotation mark) or }(closing curly brace) ahead of the match. This is implemented using a character class(square brackets) followed by the negated character class which matches to anything other than a space and a digit. This last part helps us account for texts in the data which have mutiple quotation marks. . r&#39;(?P&lt;created_at&gt;(?&lt;=&quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;)(?:[12] d{3}-(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(?:0[1-9]|[12] d|3[01])T[0-2] d: d{2}: d{2}.000Z)(?= &quot;))&#39; | . In order to extract the texts data from all the texts we use a named group called created_at to capture all the datetime data.We use a positive look behind to get the text preceded by &quot;created_at&quot;:, followed by a non-capturing group that matches either 1 or 2 as the first digit followed by three digits, then a hyphen. The next non-capturing group captures two digit numbers such in the range 01-12 using the alternation to choose between 01-09 range and 10-12 range. This is done to match the 12 months of the year. After the next hyphen(literal match) we create another non-capturing group which captures two digits in the range 01-31. Note the use of character classes and alternations to implement this regex. This is followed by T (literal match) and a range of 0-2 implemented in a character class. This is follwowed by a simple regex pattern to capture the rest of the datetime format. Note that this regex is designed to capture any legitimate date. For this assessment we could have matched the literal 2020 after created_at: but this was not done to enable reusability of regexes. . def get_tweet_ids(tweet_file): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function returns a list of ids containing all the tweet ids in the text Args: tweet_file (str, mandatory) : a text string from which ids need to be extracted.

In all the above functions note the use of matchobject.groupdict() method which returns a dictionary of the named group as key and the match object as the value. The regexes were designed to take advantage of this method from the re package (hence the use of named dictionaries in the regexes). . In the function below we use the three dictionaries we obtain from the above functions to recreate each tweet as a list of dictionaries.

Below we implement a check to make sure we are on the right track. This simple function and assert statement are there to alert us if we extract fewer than 1172 tweets ( which are the total number tweets in the sample data). Python&#39;s eval function was used to find the total number of tweets. Although eval is unreliable most times when dealing with text data, it works for this purpose to just get the number of tweets in the sample. . tweet_data_sam = [] for text in sample_data: data_pattern = r&quot; [ {.* :.* } ] ,&quot; matches = re.search(data_pattern, text) _data = matches.group()[:-1] _data = eval(_data) tweet_data_sam.append(_data) lens = [] for text in tweet_data_sam: lens.append(len(text)) print(f&quot;There are {sum(lens)} tweets in the sample data&quot;) . There are 1172 tweets in the sample data . def sanity_check(list_of_dicts): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function returns a list of texts containing all the tweet texts in the text Args: tweet_file (str, mandatory) : a tweet string from which text need to be extracted. Returns: list : List of texts in a tweet text&quot;&quot;&quot; lengths = [] i = 0 for element in list_of_dicts: lengths.append(len(element)) return sum(lengths) assert sanity_check(tweets_sample) == 1172, &quot;Total number of tweets not matching! there should 1172 tweets! &quot; . 5. Create a date dictionary . In this next step we create a nested dictionary which has the unique dates in the dataset as the keys while in the dictionary, the id of the tweet is the key and text of the tweet is the value of the dictionary. In order to create this, the function initialises an empty dictionary. We iterate through each list element looking for unique date matches which become the key of this new dictionary. . . &lt;font size=5, color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Text Preprocessing &lt;/font&gt; . Before we add the text to inner dictionary as the value, we need to preprocess it inorder to match the output of the sample file. Here is the list of preprocessing performed : . Surrogate pairs In order to refer the characters outside of the initial BMP#Basic_Multilingual_Plane), Universal Character Sets(UCS) use a pair containing a high surrogate (D800–DBFF) and a low surrogate(DC00–DFFF). Examples of these characters appearing in our text are uDDF2, uD83C, uDDEB etc. These are emoji encodings and these characters mislead the classifier and give us the wrong sample output. In order to avoid this, a regex is designed to capture these surrogate pairs. | . r&#39; *uD[8A-F][A-F0-9]{2}&#39; This regex captures anything that starts with a uD followed by either 8 or an alphabet between A and F then followed by two characters which could be between A-F and 0-9. This logic is implemented using character classes and note the use of {} to indicate exactly two characters. | . We then go on to replace quotation marks, apostrophes, less than, greater than with XML&#39;s predefined entities (note that we don&#39;t replace ampersand because it is automatically being encoded while writing the file). We also replace the n with n to match the sample output and enable formatting in our XML output | . Following this, encoding is done to allow surrogate pairs and the text is then classified. The text is now finally added to our dictionary. | . def get_date_dict(tweets): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function returns a list of texts containing all the tweet texts in the text Args: tweet_file (str, mandatory) : a tweet string from which text need to be extracted. Returns: list : List of texts in a tweet text&quot;&quot;&quot; classified_tweets = {} for list_elm in tweets: for tweet in list_elm: date_pattern = r&#39;([12] d{3}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12] d|3[01]))&#39; date = re.search(date_pattern, tweet[&#39;created_at&#39;]).group() if date not in classified_tweets: classified_tweets[date] = {} tweet_text = tweet[&#39;text&#39;] tweet_id = tweet[&#39;id&#39;] # Replace troublesome characters tweet_text = re.sub(r&#39; *uD[8A-F][A-F0-9]{2}&#39;, lambda x:eval(&#39;&quot;&#39; + x.group() + &#39;&quot;&#39;), tweet_text) tweet_text = re.sub(r&#39; &quot;&#39;, &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;, tweet_text) tweet_text = re.sub(r&quot; &#39;&quot;, &quot;&amp;apos;&quot;, tweet_text) tweet_text = re.sub(r&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, tweet_text) tweet_text = re.sub(r&quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;, tweet_text) tweet_text = re.sub(r&#39; n&#39;, &#39; n&#39;, tweet_text) # enable surrogate pass tweet_text = tweet_text.encode(&#39;utf-16&#39;, &#39;surrogatepass&#39;).decode(&#39;utf-16&#39;) # This functions language code and probability score in a tuple # Classify the text using the function language, prob = classify(tweet_text) if language == &#39;en&#39;: classified_tweets[date][tweet_id] = tweet_text return classified_tweets english_tweets_sample = get_date_dict(tweets_sample) . english_tweets_sample . {&#39;2020-05-07&#39;: {&#39;1258367403953500164&#39;: &#39;@thehill Trump’s Ridiculous Behavior about Covid19 at Pandemic Briefings Battles https://t.co/4Gjy5tQ4XI https://t.co/8vcxU75Nz4&#39;, &#39;1258367405157466112&#39;: &#39;‘Complacent’ UK draws global criticism for Covid-19 response https://t.co/Qmd2GSQPY5&#39;, &#39;1258367406285762560&#39;: &#39;@Eglisecatho @Diocese72 +55 (22)981565421 nDon&amp;apos;t you have a BRAIN? nOnly (martial law)HOME PRISON, during 30 days, of all(100%) CITIZENS will stop CORONA VIRUS. nNo more deaths. nThe economy will be normal in 30 days too. n CURE See Dra Eunara Negri discovered the CURE of CORONAVIRUS. nhttps://t.co/2uLsT6Eehn&#39;, &#39;1258367407606960129&#39;: &#39;UK contact-tracing app could fall foul of privacy law, government told n nhttps://t.co/W85NfMKadm&#39;, &#39;1258367407653040133&#39;: &#39;Do you want to be up to date with #coronavirus worldwide?

You should have 697 total tweets, not {lens}.&quot; . 6. Create the XML file . The function below writes an XML file to the current directory depending on the kind of data supplied to it. If the data given is sample, the output is XML of sample data whereas if the full data is given, the output is XML of full data. . def create_xml(classified_tweets, data_type=&#39;sample&#39;): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function returns a list of texts containing all the tweet texts in the text Args: tweet_file (str, mandatory) : a tweet string from which text need to be extracted. data_type (str, optional) : a tweet string from which text need to be extracted Returns: list : List of texts in a tweet text&quot;&quot;&quot; accepted_dataypes = [&#39;sample&#39;, &#39;full&#39;] assert data_type in accepted_dataypes, &quot;Enter a valid data type!&quot; if data_type == &#39;sample&#39;: file_name = &#39;./sample_result.xml&#39; else: file_name = &#39;./30914345.xml&#39; with open(file_name, &#39;w&#39;, encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;) as f: f.write(f&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; n&quot;&quot;&quot;) f.write(&quot;&lt;data&gt; n&quot;) for tweet_date, tweets in classified_tweets.items(): f.write(f&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;tweets date=&quot;{tweet_date}&quot;&gt; n&quot;&quot;&quot;) for tweet in tweets.items(): f.write(f&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;tweet id=&quot;{tweet[0]}&quot;&gt;{tweet[1]}&lt;/tweet&gt; n&quot;&quot;&quot;) f.write(f&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/tweets&gt; n&quot;&quot;&quot;) f.write(&quot;&lt;/data&gt; n&quot;) create_xml(english_tweets_sample) . 7. Unified function to extract english tweets . Here we create a unified function that can extract all the english tweets from a directory containing text files of tweets. The input to the function is the file_path to the directory and the data_type we want to process. Note that sample is a default argument for the function, ie, if we give the path of full files and do not mention the data_type to be full the output XML is created using sample data. This is because running full data takes a lot of compute and we want to avoid accidental runs of this function. So unless the keyword argument data_type is equal to &quot;full&quot;, the full data is not processed. . def get_english_tweets(file_path, data_type=&#39;sample&#39;): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function returns a list of texts containing all the tweet texts in the text Args: tweet_file (str, mandatory) : a tweet string from which text need to be extracted. Returns: list : List of texts in a tweet text&quot;&quot;&quot; list_of_texts = read_files(file_path) tweet_data = grab_data_tag(list_of_texts) tweets = get_full_tweets(tweet_data) classified_tweets = get_date_dict(tweets) create_xml(classified_tweets, data_type) if data_type == &#39;sample&#39;: message = &#39;Check your current directory for the output XML named sample_result.xml&#39; else: message = &#39;Check your current directory for the output XML named 30914345.xml&#39; return message . Process the full data . We now run the unified function get_english_tweets on the full data and this returns an XML file in the current directory. . file_path_full = &#39;./30914345&#39; get_english_tweets(file_path_full, data_type=&#39;full&#39;) . &#39;Check your current directory for the output XML named 30914345.xml&#39; .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
